Project-wide
- Create a .gitignore
- Turn the project into a maven project
- Turn the project into a gradl project

Server side

- Use a default port if it's not provided as a param on startup
- There's a 10-client limit. Get rid of it
- Use a timeout for clients that haven't said anything after a while
- Develop a moderator bot (plugin) that complains if a user says a word from a dictionary (use the echo plugin as a reference)
- Switch implementation to NIO
- Implement logging using log4j
- Avoid duplicate client names

Client side
- Switch implementation to NIO
- If the user doesn't provide a name when calling the client, ask for the name interactively


Advanced Topics
- Include a .gitignore at the very first revision of the project (has implications)
